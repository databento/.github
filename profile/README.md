## About Databento
Having spent many years at the world’s leading trading firms, we’ve integrated over a hundred trading venues and data providers. We've seen the massive effort and cost of taking a new dataset to production.
So, we set out to fix this, starting with the radical idea that you should only pay for the data that you use. With that, we became the world’s first market data provider to offer usage-based pricing.
Today, thousands of users—from pre-product startups to investment firms with billions in AUM—trust Databento’s APIs to provide their market data needs.
